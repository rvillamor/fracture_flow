Matlab scripts to simulate fluid flow in thin cracks

Here, we show, step-by-step, how to simulate 2D steady laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with constant density using the Local Cubic Law approximation.

The MAtlab function included here solves the Pressure Field and evaluates the Fluxes in the 2D-domain specified by the user. The numerical solution is computed using a FVM with piece-wise constant mobilities and the two-point flux approximation.
